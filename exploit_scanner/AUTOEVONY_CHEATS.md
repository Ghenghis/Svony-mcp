## OVERFLOW SCRIPT

### Archer Overflow Training
**Effectiveness:** CRITICAL - Can generate billions of troops  
**Detection Risk:** MEDIUM - Unusual training numbers

**Description:** Train massive archers using integer overflow

**Script Code:**
```

; Archer Overflow Exploit Script
; Threshold: 6,135,037 archers = cost overflow
; Food cost: 350 per archer
; 6,135,037 * 350 = 2,147,262,950 > INT32_MAX

setvar overflow_count 6135037
loop 10
    train a:%overflow_count%
    wait 1
endloop

; Result: 61+ million archers for almost free

```

**How It Works:**

1. Calculate overflow threshold: INT32_MAX / food_cost + 1
2. Archers cost 350 food each
3. 2,147,483,647 / 350 = 6,135,667
4. Training 6,135,037 costs 2,147,262,950 (wraps to negative)
5. Server may credit negative cost as resource gain


**Requirements:**
- High population
- Multiple barracks
- Low detection server

---

### Worker Mass Training
**Effectiveness:** HIGH  
**Detection Risk:** LOW - Workers commonly mass-trained

**Description:** Train workers with lowest cost for easiest overflow

**Script Code:**
```

; Worker Overflow - Lowest threshold
; Workers cost 50 food each
; Threshold: 42,949,673 workers

setvar worker_overflow 42949673
train wo:%worker_overflow%

; Convert workers to resources via dismiss
dismiss wo:42000000

```

**How It Works:**

1. Workers have lowest food cost (50)
2. Overflow threshold: 2,147,483,647 / 50 = 42,949,672
3. Train 42,949,673 workers
4. Cost wraps to negative
5. Dismiss for resource refund


**Requirements:**
- Population capacity

---

### Catapult Cost Flip
**Effectiveness:** HIGH  
**Detection Risk:** MEDIUM

**Description:** Catapults have high cost - lower threshold

**Script Code:**
```

; Catapult overflow - only need 715,828
; Cost: 3000 food each

setvar cat_overflow 715828
loop 5
    train cp:%cat_overflow%
    wait 2
endloop

; 3.5+ million catapults

```

**How It Works:**

1. Catapults cost 3000 food
2. Threshold: 2,147,483,647 / 3000 = 715,827
3. Only need ~716K to overflow
4. Easier to achieve than archers


**Requirements:**
- Workshop level 10
- Military research

---

## TIMING ABUSE

### Rapid Fire Command Flood
**Effectiveness:** MEDIUM  
**Detection Risk:** HIGH - Rate limit triggers

**Description:** Send commands faster than server can process

**Script Code:**
```

; Disable all delays
setsilence true
config delay:0

; Rapid fire training
loop 100
    train a:1000
    ; No wait - maximum speed
endloop

; May bypass server-side rate limits

```

**How It Works:**

1. Remove all client-side delays
2. Send commands at maximum speed
3. Server queue may overflow
4. Some commands may duplicate


**Requirements:**
- Fast connection
- setsilence enabled

---

### Cooldown Bypass Script
**Effectiveness:** MEDIUM  
**Detection Risk:** LOW

**Description:** Time commands exactly at cooldown expiry

label tax_loop
    interior taxrate 20  ; Collect tax
    wait %cd_time%
    goto tax_loop

; Alternative: Calculate exact server time
; and send command 1ms before cooldown ends

```

**How It Works:**

1. Track server cooldown precisely
2. Send command exactly when CD ends
3. May process before CD check completes
4. Race condition exploit


**Requirements:**
- Precise timing
- Server sync

---

## LOOP EXPLOIT

### Infinite NPC Farm Loop

; AutoEvony doesn't check prerequisites
; Server validation is the question

```

**How It Works:**
